rc-gemd is a gemini server inspired by rc-httpd.

The scripts expect to be installed under /rc/bin/rc-gemd.

The following script will allow you to test them before installing:
ramfs
mkdir /tmp/rc-gemd
bind . /tmp/rc-gemd
bind -b /tmp /rc/bin

or one can change the rc_gemd_dir setting in the script.

The server can be started with a combination of listen(8) and tlssrv(8):
aux/listen1 tcp!*!1965 tlssrv -c /lib/ssl/gem.pem /rc/bin/rc-gemd/rc-gemd

The instructions for generating TLS certificates can be found in rsa(8).
